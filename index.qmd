My research focuses on monetary policy, expectations, and macro-financial linkages, with an emphasis on how policy design and communication affect economic outcomes. My work combines theory, empirical analysis, and policy applications, often drawing on Brazilian and international data.

I am currently a Visiting Scholar at Stanford University. Previously, I served as Deputy Governor for Economic Policy at the Central Bank of Brazil, where I oversaw economic research, macroeconomic analysis, and official statistics, and contributed to monetary policy formulation and communication.
