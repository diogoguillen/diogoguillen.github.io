My research focuses on monetary policy, expectations, and macro-financial linkages, with an emphasis on how policy design and communication affect economic outcomes. My work combines theory, empirical analysis, and policy applications, often drawing on Brazilian and international data.

Before joining Stanford, I served as Deputy Governor at the Central Bank of Brazil, where I was responsible for monetary policy and economic research.
