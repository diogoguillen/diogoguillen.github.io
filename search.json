The analysis focuses on how different components of communication relate to expectation formation and the informational role of policy statements showing that central bank communication sometimes adds more noise than signal.\n\n\n\n\nAn Organizational Structure Approach to Price Setting and Monetary Policy (2025)\nwith Victor Monteiro\nCentral Bank of Brazil — Working Paper Series No. 638\nPDF\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe develop a New Keynesian framework in which price rigidity emerges endogenously from organizational structure and incentive misalignment within firms. The model generates novel implications for inflation dynamics and the transmission of monetary policy.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the Informational Footsteps of the Supply Chain Tracks (2025)\nwith Victor Monteiro and Thiago Christiano Silva\nCentral Bank of Brazil — Working Paper Series No. 640\nPDF\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper studies information propagation in production networks using a model with incomplete information at the firm level. We link information frictions, network structure, and aggregate shock transmission, and provide supporting evidence using Brazilian firm-to-firm transaction data.\n\n\n\n\nLocal Government Spending and Employment: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from Brazil (2017)\nwith Breno Braga and Benjamin Thompson\nWorking Paper\nSSRN\n\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing regression discontinuity designs, we estimate the causal effects of local government spending on employment outcomes in Brazil, providing evidence on the labor-market impact of fiscal policy at the local level."
