The analysis highlights implications for expectation formation and the predictability of policy decisions.\n\n\n\n\nAn Organizational Structure Approach to Price Setting and Monetary Policy (2025)\nwith Victor Monteiro\nCentral Bank of Brazil — Working Paper Series No. 638\nPDF\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe develop a New Keynesian framework in which price rigidity arises endogenously from organizational structure and incentive misalignment within firms. The model generates novel implications for inflation dynamics and monetary policy transmission.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the Informational Footsteps of the Supply Chain Tracks (2025)\nwith Victor Monteiro and Thiago Christiano Silva\nCentral Bank of Brazil — Working Paper Series No. 640\nPDF\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe study information propagation in production networks using a model with incomplete information at the firm level. The framework links network structure, information frictions, and aggregate shock transmission, with supporting evidence from Brazilian firm-to-firm data.\n\n\n\n\nLocal Government Spending and Employment: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from Brazil (2017)\nwith Breno Braga and Benjamin Thompson\nWorking Paper\nSSRN\n\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing regression discontinuity designs, we estimate the causal effects of local government spending on employment outcomes in Brazil.\n\n\n\n\nOptimal Policy with Liquidity Frictions (2014)\nwith Wei Cui\nWorking Paper\nSSRN\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper studies optimal monetary policy in environments with liquidity frictions, highlighting trade-offs between macroeconomic stabilization and efficiency."
